- Keep a queue of triangles to check for Delaunay and add all triangles initially, then add any new triangles as they are added from flipping
- Figure out what to do with initial points (so that the first two clicks don't seem to not do anything)
- store edges in points
- keep a handle to at least all points in the triangulation for voronoi cell generation
- generate voronoi nodes from delaunay points
